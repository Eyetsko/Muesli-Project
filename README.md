# Project - Data Analysis

This project is centered around exploratory data 
analysis [(EDA)](./EDA_Checklist.pdf) techniques and statistical analysis.

## Topic and Task

Your task will be to complete a case study to answer specific questions of our stakeholder by performing data analysis and visualisation. 
You can find the detailed task description [here](./Assignment.md).

## Suggested workflow - MVP  

The work is timeboxed, and with that in mind, you need to change how you approach the task. You will want to employ an iterative approach. 

* Write a plan of how you will complete the project. Refer to this regularly.
* When unsure or facing overly complex topics: make assumptions or simplifications that allow you to move on with your plan.
* Make simple plots
* Main questions should be answered first -> Think MVP (minimum viable product) and POC (proof of concept) 
* Iterate: go deeper, go prettier, go better
* Clean up .. feel free to delete things that are not useful anymore (even if you spent loads of time on it!)

## Suggested workflow for git

* one person forks this repository
* include or check the `.gitignore` file in your repo. At the least your **data** folder should be listed, since you want to make sure not to push any data to GitHub.
* add the other team members as a collaborators
* recommended but not necessary: work on your own branch.
* create a new .ipynb file and start with your EDA!
  - it's a good idea to split different steps into different notebooks. You can save intermediate results as `.csv`-files.
  - when working separately from team mates, use different files that can be combined later, or work carefully to avoid merge conflicts!
* split tasks in your group, push results and merge into main if other person needs your results.
* in the end: merge everything into the main branch
* at the final step ("after the project"), the team members can fork the final state of the repo so to copy it into their own GitHub.  

**Have fun and do not stress yourself too much!!!**
